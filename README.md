# PrivateOpt: Repository for Differentially Private Convex Optimization

This repository collects tutorials of differentially private convex optimization. 

These tutorials are, by large, based on the theory and applications from the following preprint

*Privacy-Preserving Convex Optimization: When Differential Privacy Meets Stochastic Programming* 

by Vladimir Dvorkin, Ferdinando Fioretto, Pascal Van Hentenryck, Pierre Pinson and Jalal Kazempour, submitted to XXX.
